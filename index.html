		<br/><h2>Treehouse's Mission</h2>
		<p left="20%"><b>Giving Foster Kids a Childhood and a Future<br/></b>We envision a world where every child that has experienced foster care has the opportunities and support that they need to pursue their dreams and launch successfully into adulthood. <br/> We promote and take action toward racial equity. We are at our strongest when we embrace and reflect the racial and cultural diversity of our community. With fierce optimism, we individually and collectively fight the structural inequities that impact all of us.

		<h2><b>Treehouse Care Package System</b></h2>
		<p><b>Each morning, nearly 10,000 children in foster care in Washington state wake up to unfamiliar surroundings. </b><br> In foster care, they are safe from physical harm and neglect, but they are far from out of the woods socially, emotionally, and academically. Trauma and loss, changes in homes and schools and emotional upheavel cause them to perform worse than their peers on every academic measure. Treehouse provides youth in foster care with access to services and items they equally deserve to be successful in school and life. <br> However, it can be difficult to get to Treehouse to receive the items here when they are placed with a new family. With the help of this website, DSHS employees can automatically make an order to send a care package to the foster child in their new placement. </p>
